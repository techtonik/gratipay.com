<h2>About Teams</h2>

<p>On Gratipay you will find users, communities and teams. Teams are sets of
people working towards a common goal. A team can represent an open-source
software project, a small time indie magazine publisher, a set of YouTubers
working together on something or generally any set of people collaborating on
the same goal.</p>

<p>Teams on Gratipay have members and can receive funds. The team's members can
make use of those funds to help support them in reaching their team's goals.</p>

<h2>Creating a team</h2>

<p>Team accounts are created just like regular accounts. Just login. Once you've
setup your team account there are three steps to change it from a regular
account into a team account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On your team's Profile page, edit the "Statement" section.</li>
  <li>Change "I am" into "We are".</li>
  <li>Save the change.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you saved the change, the navigation section on the profile page should
include a new "Members" button. This section will list all of the team's members
and allows the team owner (i.e., whoever controls the team account) to add new
members to the team.</p>

<h2>Becoming a team member</h2>

<p>After a team is first created, there are no team members. This is because a
team is in essence the same as a normal account. Adding members is very easy and
can be done by the team account owner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into the team account.</li>
  <li>Click the "Members" button on the Profile page.</li>
  <li>Type the Gratipay username of the person you want to add in the box.</li>
  <li>Click add.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your want to become a team member, contact the project that is represented
by the team account. The first member of the team will usually also be the team
account owner.</p>

<h2>Removing team membership</h2>

<p>People move, people change, life catches up to you when you least expect it.
What ever the reason, you want to stop being the member of a team.</p>

<p>Simply log into your account, go to the Members section of the team and
change your take to zero. To be a team member, you have to have a minimum take
of one penny ($ 0.01). Also see the <a href="#using-team-funds">Using team funds
</a> section below for more details on team members takes and team funding.</p>

<p>If you're the team account owner and someone has broken the team's trust or,
for example, is no longer active, you can remove them from the team too. Simply
click on their take entry for "This week" in the Members section of the team.
</p>

<p>Please note that no one, not even the team account owner, can change a
member's take. The team account owner can only add or remove members.</p>

<h2 id="using-team-funds">Using team funds</h2>

<p>So your team is receiving funds through Gratipay. Now what? How are we going
to split the funds?</p>

<p>Gratipay uses the "Kids eat first" concept.</p>

<p>The "Kids eat first" concept means that the last member added to the team is
the first to take funds out each week. That means the first team member is the
last to access funds. Any money left over after all members have taken their
share stays in the team account until next week, or is deposited into a bank
account if one is attached to the team account.</p>

<p>All team members set their own “take” of the money.</p>

<img src="{{ website.asset('teams/first-in-last-out.png') }}" />

<p>The idea is that a healthy team is built on trust, and trusting each other
with money is a powerful cause and effect of mutual trust. Team memberships and
what a member's take is, is public information. This combined with the team's
own agreements, means everyone involved in the team should have sufficient
information to reach appropriate decisions together.</p>

<p>However, it is important to understand that taking money is throttled. This
allows new members to build trust. New members start with a penny ($ 0.01) per
week.</p>

<p>As a team member, you can double your take each week (and if you’re under $1
you can increase to $1). If you set your new take higher than double the
previous take, it will be clipped to double. Here’s the throttled growth curve:
</p>

<img src="{{ website.asset('teams/take-growth-curve.png') }}" class="col0" />

<p>Note that your take does not increase automatically, and no-one else can
change it for you. This means you will have to increase your take manually each
week until you're happy. The above graph shows what happens if you increase your
take as fast as you’re allowed.</p>

<p>The idea is that, for a mature project with funds available, a new member
will generally start to flatten out their growth curve between week 10 and 12.
That gives a two to three month honeymoon period for existing team members and
new members to get to know one another, and makes it easy to add new members at
the first sign of interest as a way to encourage further participation without
worrying that they’ll take all the money and run.</p>

<p>A member can withdraw from a team by setting their take to zero. After that,
they need to be added back by the team owner. The team owner can drop members
from the team as well, in the case of broken trust or stagnant membership.
However, even the team owner can’t otherwise set takes. Only a member can change
their own take.</p>
